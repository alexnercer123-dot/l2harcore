## Transformation Details

### 1. NPC Configuration Changes

### 2. Custom AI Implementation
**File:** `dist/game/data/scripts/ai/bosses/CaravanBoss.java`

- **Mercy Pleas:** Pleads for mercy when attacked (limited to once per 10 seconds)
- **Random Messages:** 5 different mercy plea messages are randomly selected

#### Damage Tracking System
- Tracks individual player damage for participant rewards

- Maintains damage records until boss death

### 3. Reward System

#### All Participants (who dealt damage and are nearby at death)
- 2x XP/SP Scroll (ID: 29008)
- 3x 1st Class Buff Scroll (ID: 29011)  
- 1x Proof of Blood (ID: 1419)

#### Killer (whoever deals the final blow)
- 5x XP/SP Scroll - Normal (ID: 29009)
- 10x 1st Class Buff Scroll (ID: 29011)
- **Bonus (10% chance):** 4x Proof of Blood (ID: 1419)

#### Top Damage Group (party that dealt most total damage)
Each member has a chance to receive expensive NG grade equipment:
- **Weapons:** Long Sword, Cedar Staff, Falchion, Apprentice's Spear, Bow of Peril
- **Armor:** Chain Mail Shirt, Reinforced Leather Shirt, Apprentice's Tunic, Leather Pants, Great Helmet
- **Jewelry:** Ring of Knowledge, Necklace of Knowledge, Earring of Knowledge
- **Drop Rate:** 10% chance for each item

### 4. Spawn Configuration Changes
**File:** `dist/game/data/spawns/Others/CaravanSystem.xml`

- **Respawn Time:** Changed from 60 seconds to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- **Spawn Name:** Changed to "CaravanRaidBoss"
- **Location:** Same coordinates as before (17438, 147454, -3120)

### 5. Route Disabled
**File:** `dist/game/data/Routes.xml`

- The caravan walking route has been disabled (commented out)
- Boss now remains stationary at spawn location

## Mercy Plea Messages

When attacked, the boss will randomly say one of these messages (max once per 10 seconds):

1. "Please, have mercy! I'm just a simple merchant!"
2. "I beg you, spare my life! I have a family!"
3. "Stop! I surrender! Take what you want but don't kill me!"
4. "Have pity on an old trader! I mean no harm!"
5. "Please, I'll give you anything you want! Just don't hurt me!"

## Technical Implementation

### Event Handling
- Uses `OnCreatureAttacked` event for damage tracking and mercy pleas
- Uses `OnCreatureDeath` event for reward distribution
- Proper event registration for the specific NPC ID

### Reward Distribution Logic
1. **Participant Detection:** Checks all players who dealt damage
2. **Proximity Check:** Only rewards players within 1500 units of boss location
3. **Party Damage Calculation:** Sums all damage from party members
4. **Random Member Selection:** For top damage group, randomly selects nearby party member for NG drops

### Safety Features
- Null checks for players and parties
- Online status verification before giving rewards
- Distance verification for reward eligibility
- Proper cleanup of damage tracking after boss death

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Server Startup
1. Restart the game server
2. Check server logs for successful loading of:
   - NPC data (transmog.xml)
   - AI script compilation (CaravanBoss.java)
   - Spawn configuration (CaravanSystem.xml)

### 2. In-Game Testing
1. Go to coordinates: `/loc 17438 147454 -3120`
2. Look for "Caravan Trader Marcus" with title "Raid Boss"
3. Verify the NPC is attackable and has raid boss appearance
4. Test attack behavior:
   - Attack the boss and verify it doesn't fight back
   - Confirm mercy plea messages appear (max once per 10 seconds)
5. Test reward system:
   - Get multiple players to attack the boss
   - Organize into different parties
   - Kill the boss and verify reward distribution

### 3. Admin Commands
```
//spawn 900009        (manually spawn the raid boss)
//loc                 (check current coordinates)
//target CaravanBoss  (target the boss if visible)
```
