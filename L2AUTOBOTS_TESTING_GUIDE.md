# L2Autobots System Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing procedures for the L2Autobots system that has been fully ported to L2J Mobius Hardcore.

## Prerequisites

### Database Setup
1. **Import the autobot database schema:**
   ```sql
   SOURCE c:\\project\\l2hardcore\\sql\\autobots.sql;
   ```

2. **Verify tables are created:**
   - `autobots`
   - `autobot_behaviors`
   - `autobot_chat_data`
   - `autobot_sessions`
   - `autobot_skills`

### Configuration Setup
1. **Create autobot configuration file:**
   - The system will auto-create `config/autobot.properties` on first run

### 4. Chat System Testing

#### Test 4.1: Chat Responses
**Objective:** Test autobot chat interactions

**Steps:**
1. Say \"Hello TestBot\" near an autobot
2. Ask questions with \"?\"
3. Engage in general conversation

**Expected Results:**
- Autobot responds to name mentions (80% chance)
- Responds to questions (40% chance)
- Provides appropriate responses

#### Test 4.2: Random Chat
**Objective:** Test spontaneous chat generation

**Steps:**
1. Wait near autobots for extended periods
2. Observe random chat messages

**Expected Results:**
- Autobots occasionally say random messages
- Messages are contextually appropriate
- No spam or excessive chatting

### 5. Farming System Testing

#### Test 5.1: Auto-Farming
