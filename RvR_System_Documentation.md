# RvR (Race vs Race) System Documentation

## Overview
The RvR system is a comprehensive Race vs Race PvP system for L2J Mobius that awards points to races for killing players of different races, provides automatic rewards, and enforces race-based social restrictions.

## Features

### âœ… Core Features (Implemented)
- **Race Points System**: Players earn +1 point for their race when killing players of different races
- **Automatic Rewards**: Mail-based rewards when races reach configurable thresholds (100, 500, 1000 points)
- **Social Restrictions**: Race-based clan and party limitations
- **Player Commands**: `.race` command to check current race points
- **Configuration System**: Comprehensive settings via `RvR.ini` file
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage of race points
- **No Penalties**: PK points and karma disabled for inter-race kills

### ðŸ”„ Pending Features
- **Class System Overhaul**: Remove race-class restrictions (allow any race to choose any class)
- **Profession Quest Rework**: Adapt profession quests for new race/class flexibility

## Database Structure

### Table: `rvr_race_points`
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `rvr_race_points` (
  `race_name` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  `points` INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

-- Initial data
INSERT INTO `rvr_race_points` (race_name, points) VALUES 
('HUMAN', 0), ('ELF', 0), ('DARK_ELF', 0), 
('ORC', 0), ('DWARF', 0), ('KAMAEL', 0), ('ERTHEIA', 0);
```

## Configuration

### Config Variables (`Config.java`)
```java
// RvR System Configuration
public static boolean RVR_ENABLED = false;
public static boolean RVR_DISABLE_PK_FOR_DIFFERENT_RACES = true;
public static boolean RVR_CLAN_RACE_RESTRICTIONS = true;
public static boolean RVR_PARTY_RACE_RESTRICTIONS = true;

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. RvRManager (`RvRManager.java`)
- **Singleton Pattern**: Manages race points and rewards
- **Database Operations**: Persistent storage via SQL
- **Reward System**: Automatic mail delivery with item attachments
- **Race Validation**: Checks for valid player races

**Key Methods:**
- `addPoints(Race killerRace, int points)`: Adds points to a race
- `getPoints(Race race)`: Retrieves current points for a race
- `isDifferentRace(Race race1, Race race2)`: Validates if races are different
- `giveRewardToRace(String raceName, ItemHolder reward, int threshold)`: Sends rewards via mail

#### 2. Player Kill Integration (`Player.java`)
```java
// RvR System - Award points for killing different race players
if (Config.RVR_ENABLED && (target instanceof Player))
{
    final Player targetPlayer = (Player) target;
    if (RvRManager.isDifferentRace(getRace(), targetPlayer.getRace()))
    {
        RvRManager.getInstance().addPoints(getRace(), 1);
        
        // Disable PK points for different race kills
        if (Config.RVR_DISABLE_PK_FOR_DIFFERENT_RACES)
        {
            return false; // Skip normal PK point addition
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Voice Command (`RaceVoicedCommand.java`)
- **Command**: `.race`
- **Function**: Displays current race points
- **Output**: "Your race (RACE_NAME) currently has X RvR points."

#### 4. Social Restrictions

**Clan Restrictions (`Clan.java`):**
```java
// RvR System - Check race restrictions for clan membership
if (Config.RVR_ENABLED && Config.RVR_CLAN_RACE_RESTRICTIONS)
{
    final ClanMember leader = getLeader();
    if (leader != null)
    {
        final int leaderRace = leader.getRaceOrdinal();
        final int targetRace = target.getRace().ordinal();
        
        if (leaderRace != targetRace)
        {
            player.sendMessage("Only players of the same race as the clan leader can join this clan.");
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

**Party Restrictions (`RequestJoinParty.java`):**
```java
// RvR System - Check race restrictions for party formation
if (Config.RVR_ENABLED && Config.RVR_PARTY_RACE_RESTRICTIONS)
{
    // Validation for both new parties and existing party additions
    if (requestor.isInParty())
    {
        final Party currentParty = requestor.getParty();
        for (Player member : currentParty.getMembers())
        {
            if ((member != null) && (member.getRace() != target.getRace()))
            {
                requestor.sendMessage("Only players of the same race can be in the same party.");
                return;
            }
        }
    }
    else if (requestor.getRace() != target.getRace())
    {
        requestor.sendMessage("Only players of the same race can be in the same party.");
        return;
    }
}
```

## Testing Instructions

3. Test with RVR_ENABLED = false
4. Expected: "RvR System is currently disabled."
```

### 3. Reward System Testing

#### Test 4: Automatic Rewards
```
Objective: Verify automatic mail rewards

Steps:
1. Manually set race points to 99 in database:
   UPDATE rvr_race_points SET points = 99 WHERE race_name = 'HUMAN';
2. Have Human character kill different race player
3. Check mail system for reward delivery
4. Expected: Mail with subject "RvR Race Reward" and configured item attachment
5. Repeat for thresholds 500 and 1000
```

### 4. Social Restrictions Testing

```

## Debugging

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Compilation Errors
```
Problem: Import or method not found errors
Solution: Verify all import statements match L2J Mobius package structure
Check: ChatType, Race, ItemHolder, ItemData imports
```

#### Issue 2: Database Connection
```
Problem: Race points not saving
Solution: Check database connection settings
Verify: rvr_race_points table exists and is accessible
```

#### Issue 3: Rewards Not Delivered
```
Problem: Mail rewards not received
Solution: Check MailManager integration
Verify: ItemManager.createItem() method usage
Debug: Mail creation and attachment process
```

#### Issue 4: Voice Command Not Working
```
Problem: .race command not recognized
Solution: Verify RaceVoicedCommand is registered in MasterHandler
Check: Both main codebase and scripts directory versions
```

### SQL Debugging Queries
```sql
-- Check current race points
SELECT * FROM rvr_race_points ORDER BY points DESC;

-- Reset race points for testing
UPDATE rvr_race_points SET points = 0;

-- Set specific race to threshold for reward testing
UPDATE rvr_race_points SET points = 99 WHERE race_name = 'HUMAN';

-- Check mail system
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE subject LIKE '%RvR%';
```

## Future Enhancements
